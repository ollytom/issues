# My comment

> Hello, world!
> this is a test

A bit confused here.
The code says something but I'm not sure that's so important.

The reality is that it says this:

	echo hello world!

So it's not upper case according to [RFC 7666].

# Why this *matters*

Because youse are all fucked m8.
But to keep it short, without worrying about [fmt.Println]:

	* Who is your Daddy?
	* And what does he do?
	* Show me the money

[RFC 7666]: http://example.com
