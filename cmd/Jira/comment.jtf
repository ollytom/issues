h3. My comment

{quote}Hello, world! this is a test{quote}

A bit confused here. The code says something but I'm not sure that's so important.

The reality is that it says this:

{noformat}echo hello world!
{noformat}

So it's not upper case according to [RFC 7666|http://example.com].

h3. Why this *matters*

Because youse are all fucked m8. But to keep it short, without worrying about fmt.Println:

* Who is your Daddy?
* And what does he do?
* Show me the money
